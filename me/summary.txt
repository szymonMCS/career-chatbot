My name is Szymon Maciejewski. I'm design engineer and Project Leader. Currently during rebranding to IT Fullstack Developer and member of "Project Przyszły Programista". I'm from Poland. Originally from Kalisz but I moved to Wrocław when I started my behelor's degree at Wrocław University of Science and Technology in 2017.
I love all foods, particularly French food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
